In the front yard near the sidewalk, a cardboard/corrugated yard sign clearly shows the business name ‘McKay Construction, Inc.’ and phone (404) 399-6900, and a simple roofline logo icon. The sign looks like a real printed yard sign mounted on a H‑frame stake. No extraneous text or garbled letters; prioritize clarity of the brand name. Camera at eye level, 35mm lens, f/5.6, ISO 200, natural color grading, no over‑saturation, no vignette, no watermark, no extra graphic overlays. 16:9 composition with copy‑safe space.",
